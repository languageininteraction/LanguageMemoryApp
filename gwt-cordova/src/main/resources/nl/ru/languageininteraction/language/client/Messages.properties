aboutScreenTextCheading=<h3>More language apps</h3>
aboutScreenTextEbody=Some of the languages come from the <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://dobes.mpi.nl/'',''_system''); return false;">DOBES Archive</a>, which contains a great variety of languages from around the world that are in danger of becoming extinct. We would like to thank the following researchers for contributions. <br />Development: Peter Withers, Sean Roberts, Mark Dingemanse, Hedvig Skirgard, Pashiera Barkhuysen<br /><br />Language Data:<br />Akie: Christa Konig and Karten Legere<br />Bayso: Graziano Sava<br />Bora: Frank Seifart<br />Cashinahua: Eliane Camargo, Sabine Reiter<br />Chintang: Sabine Stoll, Balthasar Bickel, Martin Gaenszle, Novel Kishor Rai, Elena Lieven, Goma Banjade, Toya Nath Bhatta, Netra Paudyal, Judith Pettigrew, Ichchha P.

aboutScreenTextBbody=<p>LingQuest was developed within the research consortium <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl'',''_system''); return false;">Language in Interaction</a>, which aims to explain variation and similarities in languages as well as in linguistic skills. The consortium aims to gain understanding of how such a large range of (cultural) differences have arisen from a biological basis that is common to all people.</p><p>The research program examines human language from the level of genetics to interactions between conversational partners, addressing a diverse range of topics such as: brain structure and function, language development, evolution, multilingualism, speech production and comprehension, nonverbal behaviour, meaning and context, and the interplay of language with other cognitive systems (e.g. memory).</p>
aboutScreenTextAbody=LingQuest is a game about the diversity of the world''s languages. Try to match recordings of speakers speaking the same language.
