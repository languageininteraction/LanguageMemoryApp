aboutScreenTextBbody=<p>LingQuest was developed within the research consortium <a href="#" onclick="window.open(''http://www.languageininteraction.nl'',''_system''); return false;">Language in Interaction</a>, which aims to explain variation and similarities in languages as well as in linguistic skills. The consortium aims to gain understanding of how such a large range of (cultural) differences have arisen from a biological basis that is common to all people.</p><p>The research program examines human language from the level of genetics to interactions between conversational partners, addressing a diverse range of topics such as: brain structure and function, language development, evolution, multilingualism, speech production and comprehension, nonverbal behaviour, meaning and context, and the interplay of language with other cognitive systems (e.g. memory).</p>
aboutScreenTextAbody=LingQuest is a game about the diversity of the world''s languages. Try to match recordings of speakers speaking the same language.
